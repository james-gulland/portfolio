Dedicated, thorough, helpful and always keen to learn anything new, are all the traits that make him an asset and an absolute pleasure to work alongside. I will temper my glowing praise so as not to rouse suspicions of hyperbole but before I do I must say: I can't recommend James highly enough to anybody who may need his experience as a developer, covering a wide array of tools.<br /><br />James, keep on being AWESOME!",

    text: "What a pleasure it was to have James on my team. He joined us as an entry-level developer, but I could immediately tell he would thrive.<br/><br/>James brought with him extensive experience as a product owner, which proved to be an exceptional asset. His background gave him a sharp eye for detail, both in terms of how websites functioned for end users and in ensuring clean, reusable code for future maintenance.<br />He has a positive attitude, is highly articulate, eager to learn, and an all-around pleasure to work with every day.<br /><br/>Thank you James!",

    text: "James is a guy that you want on your team. He's incredibly understanding, incredibly capable of delivering features within a deadline, and driving real change and vision.<br /><br />He adapts to the environment around him with ease. One of the many examples include his continuous work and improvements to support bi-monthly marketing campaign cycles on our e-commerce site. The campaign cycle at Pizza Hut is filled with lots of details to capture, lots of conversations with many departments, while balance customer and team needs - all of which James has mastered in a very short period of time. If that's not indicative of his ability to juggle extreme breadth and depth of software delivery - I don't know what is.",

    text: "James and I worked quite closely together when he was one of my main client stakeholders at Subway. James was always a pleasure to work with, understood the challenges our team faced with delivery, and constantly advocated the fine balance between the two practices.<br /><br />James and I maintained a very transparent professional relationship, our cards were always on the table, which allowed us to be candid with one another. This only benefited the partnership between AND and Subway further as this empowered us to land on solutions faster and in a less bureaucratic manner. Which ultimately, gave our team the right tools to deliver at pace and at valuable increments. Consistently.",

    text: "I was so glad I had chance to work with James for one of the highly prioritised project at Just Eat and I enjoyed every single day working with him.<br /><br />James is a true professional and proved it many times. He understands every single aspect of how to make a excellent product, he is a big fan of UCD and provided me big support throughout my user research process. He is very organised person and clear on what he is doing and always make sure all developers are on the same page and get what they need for the implementation.<br /><br />I highly recommend James",
